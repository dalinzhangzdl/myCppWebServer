<p>There are two open source projects by me.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalinzhangzdl/AI_Car_Raspberry-pi">AI_Car_Raspberry-pi:</a>
AI_Car_Raspberry-pi is a python progam for making your own AI car based on raspberry-pi. In this project,
	You can use the Raspberry Pi to implement image recognition, QR code recognition, speech recognition and speech synthesis, and intelligent driving cars based on artificial neural networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalinzhangzdl/BCI_MI_Wavelet_CNN">BCI_MI_Wavelet_CNN: </a>BCI_MI_Wavelet_CNN is based on python and tensorflow. Deep learning has achieved good results in CV, NLP and etc. 
	In Brain-Computer-Interface research, deep learning methods are rarely used. In this reasearch, we innovatively combine wavelet transform time-frequency image features and convolutional neural networks to achieve MI classification <p>
